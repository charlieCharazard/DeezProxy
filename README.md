I've acquired computer knowledge 

To anyone who knows an ounce of knowledge about how the heck to do this, I would greatly appreciate any insight. Thank you! 

Normally you would paste this into the terminal:

git clone https://github.com/NightProxy/space.git
cd Space
pnpm i
pnpm start


However, issues have risen where the codespace wont even open/load.
